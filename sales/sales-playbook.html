<strong>Always sell OUTCOMES, not features:</strong>
<ul><li>❌ "We automate review requests"</li>
<li>✅ "You'll stack up 5-star reviews, rank higher on Google, and get more calls"</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>THE NEW TIGHT SCRIPT (2026)</h2>

<strong>Context:</strong> Kai closed 3 clients in 19 minutes (8 min, 7 min, 4 min). $234K MRR, 730 clients, signing ~9 clients/day.

<h3>Pre-Call Requirements</h3>

<strong>CRITICAL: Send VSL Before Every Call</strong>
<ul><li>5-6 minute video covering: what we do, how it makes them money, price ($297/month)</li>
<li>Without VSL, you're speaking different languages</li>
<li>If they haven't watched, make them watch ON THE CALL or reschedule</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Script Flow</h3>

<pre><code>1. OPENING (10 seconds)
   "Hey man, did you get a chance to watch that short video I sent over to you?"

<p>   → YES: Continue<br>   → NO: "No worries, it's only 6 minutes. Let me send it to you now and you can watch it real quick."</p>

<ol><li class="ordered">CONFIRM (5 seconds)</li>
</ol>   "Awesome, you're the man. Well, that's exactly what we do."

<ol><li class="ordered">THE QUESTION (5 seconds)</li>
</ol>   "That being said, what questions do you have?"

<p>   → If they have questions: Answer briefly, move on<br>   → If no questions: They're ready to close</p>

<ol><li class="ordered">THE HAMMER (use anytime you're lost)</li>
</ol>   "Cool. What other questions do you have?"

<p>   This is your catch-all. Use it to:<br>   - Bring them back when they go off-topic<br>   - Reel in talkative prospects<br>   - Get permission to close</p>

<ol><li class="ordered">PERMISSION TO CLOSE</li>
</ol>   "Do you have any other questions before I get you going?"

<p>   → "No" = CLOSE<br>   → More questions = Answer, repeat</p>

<ol><li class="ordered">CLOSE (Assume the close throughout)</li>
</ol>   "Cool, let me get some info from you..."
   - Name
   - Business name
   - Address
   - CARD NUMBER LAST (always)
</code></pre>

<h3>Key Principles</h3>

<strong>1. ASSUME THE CLOSE</strong>
<ul><li>Don't ask permission, state what will happen</li>
<li>"We'll just have you fill out the onboarding form..."</li>
<li>"We'll be done in about 7-9 days..."</li>
<li>"Which company do you want us to work on?" (not "if")</li>
</ul>
<strong>2. BE POLARIZING</strong>
Say things they've NEVER heard from a salesperson:
<ul><li>"We're gonna try to sell you more shit later once you're happy. Just so you know."</li>
<li>"If you don't have a website, that's the best case scenario. Otherwise I have to convince you your website's shit."</li>
<li>"Contracts? No, we don't do contracts. Those are just used to scare you into not canceling."</li>
<li>"Nobody's chasing you down for 300 bucks."</li>
</ul>
<strong>3. SAME SIDE OF THE TABLE ENERGY</strong>
<ul><li>Don't feel like you're convincing them across a table</li>
<li>Feel like you're walking a friend through something</li>
<li>Casual, cool, calm, collected</li>
<li>"Bro, you gotta at least attach your website to your Google page, man" [laugh]</li>
</ul>
<strong>4. MAKE THEM PROBLEM AWARE</strong>
<ul><li>Point out issues casually (not salesy)</li>
<li>"See how your phone number isn't hyperlinked? People with bad eyes can't even click to call."</li>
<li>Give them "lightbulb moments" where they realize the problem</li>
</ul>
<strong>5. CREDIT CARD ALWAYS LAST</strong>
<ul><li>Get name, address, business info first</li>
<li>By the time you ask for card, they're already committed</li>
</ul>

<h2>OBJECTION HANDLING DATABASE</h2>

<h3>Frequency Legend</h3>
<ul><li>(HIGH) = Appears in 10+ calls</li>
<li>(MED) = Appears in 5-9 calls</li>
<li>(LOW) = Appears in 1-4 calls</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3>OBJECTION: "I don't have a website" (HIGH)</h3>

<strong>Response:</strong>
<blockquote>"That's actually the best case scenario for us. Otherwise I have to convince you your website's shit and we should rebuild it. If you don't have anything, we just set it all up for you fresh."</blockquote>

<strong>Why it works:</strong> Reframes perceived weakness as advantage. Polarizing.

<hr>

<h3>OBJECTION: "Do you have contracts?" (HIGH)</h3>

<strong>Response:</strong>
<blockquote>"No, we don't do contracts. Contracts are literally just used to scare you into not canceling. Nobody's chasing you down for 300 bucks, bro."</blockquote>

<strong>Why it works:</strong> Confident tone reframes their concern. They expect you to get defensive.

<hr>

<h3>OBJECTION: "I've been burned by 3 other companies" (HIGH)</h3>

<strong>Response:</strong>
<blockquote>[Be different] "Look, I'm not going to sit here and promise you the world. What I can tell you is here's exactly what we do [point to video]. You either think it's worth $297 or you don't. I can't guarantee Susan's going to see your website and decide to give you $50,000. What I can guarantee is you'll have the systems in place that make that possible."</blockquote>

<strong>Why it works:</strong> Honest, not salesy, no false promises = different from everyone else

<hr>

<h3>OBJECTION: "How many leads will I get?" / "When will I get leads?" (HIGH)</h3>

<strong>Best Response (from Kai commentary):</strong>
<blockquote>"I'm gonna be real with you. I cannot prove to you that in 2 months, Susan saw your Google reviews and your website and said 'holy shit these guys look professional' and decided to give you a $15,000 job. I can't prove that correlation. What I do know is the guys who have professional websites, tons of reviews, and fast follow-up are the ones winning. Does that make sense?"</blockquote>

<strong>Why it works:</strong> Sets realistic expectations, avoids overpromising, logical

<hr>

<h3>OBJECTION: "It seems expensive" / "That's a lot" (MED)</h3>

<strong>Response:</strong>
<blockquote>"What's your average job ticket? $10K-$20K? So if you get ONE job off this system in an entire YEAR, you're still 3-6x'ing what you're paying us. It's $297 a month - one job pays for 3 years."</blockquote>

<strong>Why it works:</strong> Simple ROI math in their language

<hr>

<h3>OBJECTION: "I need to think about it" (MED)</h3>

<strong>Response:</strong>
<blockquote>"For sure, man. Listen, I'm not here to pressure you. What specifically do you need to think about? Maybe I can help clarify something."</blockquote>

<p>Then:<br><blockquote>"Look, you either think this is worth $297 or you don't. What you saw in the video is exactly what you get. No tricks."</blockquote></p>

<hr>

<h3>OBJECTION: "Let me talk to my partner/wife" (MED)</h3>

<strong>Response:</strong>
<blockquote>"Totally get it. When do you think you'll have that conversation? Let's get something on the calendar so I can answer any questions they might have too."</blockquote>

<strong>Note from Kai:</strong> Wife/partner objection is hardest. They often say "it doesn't feel right" without specifics.

<hr>

<h3>OBJECTION: "I'm already working with someone for SEO/reviews" (MED)</h3>

<strong>Response:</strong>
<blockquote>"No problem. What are you paying? What results have you gotten? ... Look, 95% of companies are totally full of shit, honestly. If it's working for you, stick with it. But understand what we do is the foundation - website, reviews, missed call follow-up, remarketing. That's different from just SEO."</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>OBJECTION: "Do you do lead generation?" (HIGH)</h3>

<strong>Response:</strong>
<blockquote>"I hate marketing ourselves as a lead generation company. You're paying $297 for pre-built business SYSTEMS that I spent a long time creating. The leads come as a byproduct of having these systems in place - professional website, Google reviews, missed call follow-up. If you want direct lead gen, you need paid ads at $1,500-3,000/month. We don't even do that."</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>OBJECTION: "What happens if I cancel? Do I keep the website?" (MED)</h3>

<strong>Response:</strong>
<blockquote>"Yeah, if you cancel, there's a one-time buyout fee of $1,000 and everything transfers to you - the website, everything. What you lose access to is the automations - review sequences, auto call text back, remarketing campaigns. That's what you're paying us for."</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>OBJECTION: "I can do this myself" (LOW)</h3>

<strong>Response:</strong>
<blockquote>"You absolutely can. Same way I could watch YouTube and figure out how to fix my own roof. But I'm gonna call a roofer because that's what he does every day. That's what we do - this is all we do, all day, every day. You should be out doing jobs, not messing with websites."</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>OBJECTION: "I'm not tech savvy" (MED)</h3>

<strong>Response:</strong>
<blockquote>"Perfect. That's why we exist. We handle everything. All you do is fill out an onboarding form - basic business info, pictures, services. We build everything. You just approve it."</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>OBJECTION: "I don't have a Google Business Page" (MED)</h3>

<strong>Response:</strong>
<blockquote>"That's free to set up - takes about 5 days to verify. I'll send you a video showing exactly how to do it. If anyone tries to charge you for that, they're full of shit. While you're setting that up, we'll build your website. By the time you're verified, everything will be ready to connect."</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>OBJECTION: "My phone doesn't ring enough" / "I need work NOW" (MED)</h3>

<strong>Response:</strong>
<blockquote>"I hear you. The website and reviews are the foundation - that's what we set up. That's how people find you organically on Google. If you need leads TODAY, that's paid ads - you're looking at $1,500-3,000/month with someone managing it plus ad spend. We don't do that. What we do is make sure when leads DO come, you capture them, follow up, and convert them."</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>QUESTION DATABASE</h2>

<h3>Q: "How does this work?" / "Walk me through it"</h3>
<blockquote>"Did you watch the video? [Yes] Cool, that's literally it. Four systems: website, Google reviews, auto call text back, remarketing campaigns. What specific questions do you have about any of those?"</blockquote>

<h3>Q: "How long does it take?"</h3>
<blockquote>"8-9 days from when you submit the onboarding form. You fill out the form, we build everything, then we hop on a launch call to go over it together."</blockquote>

<h3>Q: "What do I need to do?"</h3>
<blockquote>"Three things: Fill out the onboarding form (basic business info, services, pictures), connect your Google My Business page (I'll send you a video), and send us photos of your work. That's it."</blockquote>

<h3>Q: "What about SEO?"</h3>
<blockquote>"Everything we build is optimized for SEO - pages for each service, pages for each service area, proper keywords. The reviews are huge for SEO. If you want ADVANCED SEO - backlinks, weekly blog posts, keyword reports - that's our $997/month plan. But honestly, don't do that until you have 70+ reviews and we've been working together 3 months."</blockquote>

<h3>Q: "Can I make changes to the website?"</h3>
<blockquote>"You can change wording and pictures, no problem. What I don't want you doing is messing with the structure or layout - there's custom code for speed optimization. If you want sections added or changed, just tell us and we'll do it."</blockquote>

<h3>Q: "Do you do Facebook/Instagram ads?"</h3>
<blockquote>"We're launching a self-serve ad platform soon where you can launch your own ads in 3 clicks. But traditional managed ads are $1,500-3,000/month. We don't do that currently."</blockquote>

<h2>LIGHTBULB MOMENTS (What Makes Them Buy)</h2>

<ol><li class="ordered"><strong>The Phone Number Test</strong></li>
</ol>   > "See how your phone number isn't hyperlinked? My mom's in her 70s, has bad eyes - she can't read that small text. She's gonna leave your site. [They check their site] There should be a big CALL NOW button."

<ol><li class="ordered"><strong>The Review Trap</strong></li>
</ol>   > "You have 8 reviews after 18 years. I KNOW you've served more than 8 people. You just don't ask. We automate that - every job done, review request goes out. They get reminded 4 times until they leave one."

<ol><li class="ordered"><strong>The Missed Call Reality</strong></li>
</ol>   > "When you're on a roof or under a sink and miss a call, what happens? That person calls the next guy. With auto text back, they get 'Hey sorry, I'm with a customer, can I call you back in 20 min?' and they wait for YOU."

<ol><li class="ordered"><strong>The Susan Story</strong></li>
</ol>   > "Susan is shopping for a $50K kitchen remodel. She Googles you, sees 8 reviews and a janky website. She Googles your competitor, sees 150 reviews and a beautiful site. Who's she calling? That's what we fix."

<ol><li class="ordered"><strong>The Christmas Blast</strong></li>
</ol>   > "You have 500 past customers in a spreadsheet? With one click we can text all 500: 'Hey, 10% off for past customers this month.' One guy got $100K in jobs in a week from a text blast."

<hr>

<h2>CLOSING SEQUENCES</h2>

<h3>Standard Close</h3>
<pre><code>"Awesome, no more questions? Cool, let me get some info from you."
"What's the official business name?"
"And the address?"
"Perfect. And what's the card number?"
[Always card LAST]
</code></pre>

<h3>The Soft Qualifier Close</h3>
<pre><code>"Look, I'm not here to convince you you need this. You either think it's worth $297 or you don't. If you want to grow and have these systems in place, we can help. If you're good with word of mouth and pen and paper, that's cool too. What do you want to do?"
</code></pre>

<h3>The Trial Close (for hesitant prospects)</h3>
<pre><code>"Tell you what - let me start you on the $197 plan today. If in 3-4 months you're seeing the value, just be honest with me and we'll upgrade you to the full plan. Sound fair?"
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>CALL STRUCTURE BY TYPE</h2>

<ul><li>Watched video</li>
<li>No questions or minimal questions</li>
<li>"When can we start?"</li>

<h2>RED FLAGS (When to Disqualify)</h2>

<ol><li class="ordered"><strong>No Google Business Page AND don't want to make one</strong></li>
</ol>   > "Go make the Google page first. It's free. Call me back when it's verified."

<ol><li class="ordered"><strong>Expect guaranteed leads</strong></li>
</ol>   > Set expectations clearly. If they push back, they'll be a problem customer.

<ol><li class="ordered"><strong>Budget objection on $297</strong></li>
</ol>   > If $297/month is a stretch, they're probably not doing enough business to benefit.

<ol><li class="ordered"><strong>Wife/partner makes all decisions and isn't on call</strong></li>
</ol>   > Get them BOTH on the next call or move on.
