<pre><code>═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 1: CONFIRM VIDEO (15 seconds)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

<p>YOU: "Hey [Name], how's it going man?"</p>

<p>[Let them respond]</p>

<p>YOU: "Awesome. Hey quick question - did you get a chance to<br>watch that short video I sent over?"</p>

<p>→ IF YES: Go to Phase 2<br>→ IF NO: Go to Section 3 (Handling "I Haven't Watched")</p>

<p>═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br>PHASE 2: OPEN FOR QUESTIONS (10 seconds)<br>═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>

<p>YOU: "Perfect, appreciate you watching that. So yeah, that video<br>is pretty much exactly what we do. That being said - what<br>questions do you have?"</p>

<p>→ IF QUESTIONS: Answer briefly, then ask "What other questions?"<br>→ IF NO QUESTIONS: Go to Phase 4 (Permission to Close)</p>

<p>═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br>PHASE 3: ANSWER LOOP (1-5 minutes)<br>═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>

<p>[Answer their question - keep it brief, 30-60 seconds max]</p>

<p>YOU: "Does that make sense?"</p>

<p>[They confirm]</p>

<p>YOU: "Cool. What other questions do you have?"</p>

<p>[Repeat until they say "no more questions" or "I think I'm good"]</p>

<p>═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br>PHASE 4: PERMISSION TO CLOSE (10 seconds)<br>═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>

<p>YOU: "Awesome. Any other questions before I get you going?"</p>

<p>→ IF "NO": Go to Phase 5<br>→ IF MORE QUESTIONS: Answer, repeat Phase 4<br>→ IF OBJECTION: Handle it (see Section 4), then repeat Phase 4</p>

<p>═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br>PHASE 5: CLOSE (1-2 minutes)<br>═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>

<p>YOU: "Perfect. Let me grab some info from you real quick."</p>

<p>"What's the official business name?"<br>[Write it down]</p>

<p>"And what's the best address for the business?"<br>[Write it down]</p>

<p>"Cool. And what's the card number?"<br>[Enter into Stripe/GHL]</p>

<p>"Expiration?"<br>[Enter]</p>

<p>"And the 3 digits on the back?"<br>[Enter]</p>

<p>"Perfect, you're all set. You're gonna get a text from us<br>in about 20 minutes with the onboarding form. Fill that<br>out and we'll have everything built in about 8-9 days."</p>

<pre><code>THEM: "No, I didn't get a chance to watch it yet."

<p>YOU: "No worries at all. It's only about 5 minutes.<br>You have a sec to watch it real quick? I can wait."</p>

<p>THEM: "Yeah sure, let me pull it up."</p>

<p>YOU: "Perfect. I just sent it to you again via text.<br>Let me know when you've got it pulled up."</p>

<p>[Wait for them to confirm]</p>

<p>YOU: "Cool, I'll just hang here. Take your time, watch<br>the whole thing, and let me know when you're done."</p>

<p>[MUTE YOURSELF. Let them watch. 5-6 minutes.]</p>

<p>[When they finish]</p>

<p>YOU: "Cool, appreciate you taking the time. So that's<br>pretty much exactly what we do. What questions do you have?"</p>

<p>[Continue with Phase 2]<br></code></pre></p>

<h3 id="scenario-b-they-re-driving">Scenario B: They're Driving</h3>

<pre><code>THEM: "No, I'm actually driving right now."

<p>YOU: "No worries man, safety first. Here's what we can do -<br>I'll shoot you the link right now, you watch it when you<br>get where you're going, and then just text me 'ready' and<br>I'll call you right back. Sound good?"</p>

<p>THEM: "Yeah that works."</p>

<p>YOU: "Perfect. What's the best number to text you on -<br>is it this one you're calling from?"</p>

<p>[Confirm number]</p>

<p>YOU: "Cool. Watch the video, text me 'ready', and I'll<br>call you within 5 minutes. Talk soon."</p>

<p>[End call. Send VSL link immediately. Wait for their text.]<br></code></pre></p>

<h3 id="scenario-c-they-re-busy-in-a-rush">Scenario C: They're Busy / In a Rush</h3>

<pre><code>THEM: "No, I didn't watch it. Can you just give me the
quick rundown?"

<p>YOU: "I hear you man, but honestly the video does a way<br>better job than I can in 2 minutes. It shows you real<br>client results and exactly how everything works.</p>

<p>Tell you what - it's only 5 minutes. Watch it tonight<br>and let's reschedule for tomorrow. What time works?"</p>

<p>[Book new appointment]</p>

<p>YOU: "Perfect. I'll send you the link right now. Watch<br>it before our call tomorrow and come with any questions.<br>Talk then."<br></code></pre></p>

<h3 id="scenario-d-they-refuse-to-watch">Scenario D: They Refuse to Watch</h3>

<pre><code>THEM: "Can't you just tell me what it is? I don't have
time for videos."

<p>YOU: "I totally get it. Here's the thing though - we've<br>found that guys who watch the video first have way better<br>calls because we're on the same page. Otherwise I'm just<br>gonna be repeating everything that's in the video anyway.</p>

<p>It's 5 minutes. Can you commit to watching it before we<br>talk again?"</p>

<p>→ IF YES: Reschedule<br>→ IF STILL NO: "No worries man, sounds like the timing<br>   might not be right. Feel free to book another call<br>   when you've got a few minutes to check it out."</p>

<p>[End call. Don't waste time on people who won't invest<br>5 minutes. They won't be good clients.]<br></code></pre></p>

<h3 id="how-many-leads-will-i-get">"How many leads will I get?"</h3>

<pre><code>"I'm gonna be straight with you - I can't tell you that
Susan is gonna see your Google reviews and give you a
$20K job. I can't prove that correlation.

<p>What I do know is the contractors who have professional<br>websites, tons of reviews, and fast follow-up are the<br>ones winning. We give you all the systems to make that<br>happen.</p>

<p>You think it's worth $297 or you don't. But I'm not<br>gonna promise you X leads per month because that would<br>be bullshit."<br></code></pre></p>

<h3 id="i-ve-been-burned-by-other-companies">"I've been burned by other companies"</h3>

<pre><code>"I hear that a lot actually. Most marketing companies
overpromise and underdeliver.

<p>Here's how we're different - I'm not promising you leads.<br>I'm giving you systems. The website, the reviews, the<br>missed call follow-up. You saw it in the video.</p>

<p>It either makes sense for $297 or it doesn't. No contracts,<br>cancel anytime. What other questions do you have?"<br></code></pre></p>

<h3 id="that-s-expensive-i-need-to-think-about-it">"That's expensive" / "I need to think about it"</h3>

<pre><code>"I get it. Let me ask you this - what's your average job
ticket? $5K? $10K?

<p>So if these systems help you land ONE extra job this year,<br>you're 3-4x'ing what you paid us. One job.</p>

<p>And honestly, $297 is about what you'd spend taking your<br>crew to lunch twice. But I hear you - what specifically<br>do you need to think about?"<br></code></pre></p>

<h3 id="do-you-have-contracts">"Do you have contracts?"</h3>

<pre><code>"Nope. No contracts. Those are just used to trap people
who want to leave. We don't do that.

<p>You can cancel anytime. If we're not delivering value,<br>you shouldn't be paying us. Simple as that."<br></code></pre></p>

<h3 id="let-me-talk-to-my-wife-partner">"Let me talk to my wife/partner"</h3>

<pre><code>"Totally get it. When do you think you'll have that
conversation?

<p>[They give timeframe]</p>

<p>Cool, let's get something on the calendar for [day after].<br>That way I can answer any questions they have too.<br>What time works?"<br></code></pre></p>

<h3 id="i-don-t-have-a-website-yet">"I don't have a website yet"</h3>

<pre><code>"That's actually perfect. Means we don't have to convince
you your current website sucks. We just build you a good
one from scratch.

<h3 id="payment-options">Payment Options</h3>

<strong>Option A: Collect Card Verbally (Default)</strong>
Best for: phone calls, quick closes

<strong>Option B: Send Payment Link</strong>
Best for: if they hesitate on giving card over phone
<blockquote>"I can send you a secure payment link if you'd prefer to enter it yourself"</blockquote>
[PAYMENT_LINK: Use GHL Payments or Stripe invoice link]

<strong>Why this order:</strong> By the time you ask for the card, they've already given you 3-4 pieces of info. They're committed. The card feels like "one more thing" not "the big moment."

<h3 id="if-card-declines">If Card Declines</h3>

<pre><code>YOU: "Hmm, looks like that one didn't go through.
You have another card we can try?"

<p>[If yes, try again]</p>
