<h2>1. PRE-CALL: VSL REQUIREMENT</h2>

<h3>Why the VSL is Non-Negotiable</h3>

<p>The VSL does 90% of the selling:<br><ul><li>Explains what we do</li><br><li>Shows real results</li><br><li>States the price ($297)</li><br><li>Pre-handles objections</li><br></ul><br><strong>Without VSL:</strong> 30-45 min call, low close rate, exhausting<br><strong>With VSL:</strong> 5-10 min call, high close rate, scalable</p>

<h3>VSL Delivery Sequence</h3>

<pre><code>[Lead fills form]
    ↓
[Immediate text]: "Hey [Name]! Before our call, watch this
5-min video so you know exactly what we do: [VSL LINK]"
    ↓
[24hr before call text]: "Hey [Name], just a reminder about
our call tomorrow at [TIME]. Make sure you've watched this
quick video first: [VSL LINK]"
    ↓
[2hr before call text]: "See you in 2 hours! Quick reminder
to watch this if you haven't: [VSL LINK]"
</code></pre>

<h2>2. THE TIGHT SCRIPT</h2>

<h3>Full Script with Timing</h3>

<pre><code>═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 1: CONFIRM VIDEO (15 seconds)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

<p>YOU: "Hey [Name], how's it going man?"</p>

<p>[Let them respond]</p>

<p>YOU: "Awesome. Hey quick question - did you get a chance to<br>watch that short video I sent over?"</p>

<p>→ IF YES: Go to Phase 2<br>→ IF NO: Go to Section 3 (Handling "I Haven't Watched")</p>

<p>═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br>PHASE 2: OPEN FOR QUESTIONS (10 seconds)<br>═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>

<p>YOU: "Perfect, you're the man. So yeah, that video is pretty<br>much exactly what we do. That being said - what questions<br>do you have?"</p>

<p>→ IF QUESTIONS: Answer briefly, then ask "What other questions?"<br>→ IF NO QUESTIONS: Go to Phase 4 (Permission to Close)</p>

<p>═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br>PHASE 3: ANSWER LOOP (1-5 minutes)<br>═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>

<p>[Answer their question - keep it brief, 30-60 seconds max]</p>

<p>YOU: "Does that make sense?"</p>

<p>[They confirm]</p>

<p>YOU: "Cool. What other questions do you have?"</p>

<p>[Repeat until they say "no more questions" or "I think I'm good"]</p>

<p>═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br>PHASE 4: PERMISSION TO CLOSE (10 seconds)<br>═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>

<p>YOU: "Awesome. Any other questions before I get you going?"</p>

<p>→ IF "NO": Go to Phase 5<br>→ IF MORE QUESTIONS: Answer, repeat Phase 4<br>→ IF OBJECTION: Handle it (see Section 4), then repeat Phase 4</p>

<p>═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br>PHASE 5: CLOSE (1-2 minutes)<br>═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>

<p>YOU: "Perfect. Let me grab some info from you real quick."</p>

<p>"What's the official business name?"<br>[Write it down]</p>

<p>"And what's the best address for the business?"<br>[Write it down]</p>

<p>"Cool. And what's the card number?"<br>[Enter into Stripe/GHL]</p>

<p>"Expiration?"<br>[Enter]</p>

<p>"And the 3 digits on the back?"<br>[Enter]</p>

<p>"Perfect, you're all set. You're gonna get a text from us<br>in about 20 minutes with the onboarding form. Fill that<br>out and we'll have everything built in about 8-9 days."</p>

<p>═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════<br></code></pre></p>

<h2>3. HANDLING "I HAVEN'T WATCHED"</h2>

<h3>Scenario A: They're Ready to Watch Now</h3>

<pre><code>THEM: "No, I didn't get a chance to watch it yet."

<p>YOU: "No worries at all. It's only about 5 minutes.<br>You have a sec to watch it real quick? I can wait."</p>

<p>THEM: "Yeah sure, let me pull it up."</p>

<p>YOU: "Perfect. I just sent it to you again via text.<br>Let me know when you've got it pulled up."</p>

<p>[Wait for them to confirm]</p>

<p>YOU: "Cool, I'll just hang here. Take your time, watch<br>the whole thing, and let me know when you're done."</p>

<p>[MUTE YOURSELF. Let them watch. 5-6 minutes.]</p>

<p>[When they finish]</p>

<p>YOU: "Cool, you're the man for watching that. So that's<br>pretty much exactly what we do. What questions do you have?"</p>

<p>[Continue with Phase 2]<br></code></pre></p>

<h3>Scenario B: They're Driving</h3>

<pre><code>THEM: "No, I'm actually driving right now."

<p>YOU: "No worries man, safety first. Here's what we can do -<br>I'll shoot you the link right now, you watch it when you<br>get where you're going, and then just text me 'ready' and<br>I'll call you right back. Sound good?"</p>

<p>THEM: "Yeah that works."</p>

<p>YOU: "Perfect. What's the best number to text you on -<br>is it this one you're calling from?"</p>

<p>[Confirm number]</p>

<p>YOU: "Cool. Watch the video, text me 'ready', and I'll<br>call you within 5 minutes. Talk soon."</p>

<p>[End call. Send VSL link immediately. Wait for their text.]<br></code></pre></p>

<h3>Scenario C: They're Busy / In a Rush</h3>

<pre><code>THEM: "No, I didn't watch it. Can you just give me the
quick rundown?"

<p>YOU: "I hear you man, but honestly the video does a way<br>better job than I can in 2 minutes. It shows you real<br>client results and exactly how everything works.</p>

<p>Tell you what - it's only 5 minutes. Watch it tonight<br>and let's reschedule for tomorrow. What time works?"</p>

<p>[Book new appointment]</p>

<p>YOU: "Perfect. I'll send you the link right now. Watch<br>it before our call tomorrow and come with any questions.<br>Talk then."<br></code></pre></p>

<h3>Scenario D: They Refuse to Watch</h3>

<pre><code>THEM: "Can't you just tell me what it is? I don't have
time for videos."

<p>YOU: "I totally get it. Here's the thing though - we've<br>found that guys who watch the video first have way better<br>calls because we're on the same page. Otherwise I'm just<br>gonna be repeating everything that's in the video anyway.</p>

<p>It's 5 minutes. Can you commit to watching it before we<br>talk again?"</p>

<p>→ IF YES: Reschedule<br>→ IF STILL NO: "No worries man, sounds like the timing<br>   might not be right. Feel free to book another call<br>   when you've got a few minutes to check it out."</p>

<p>[End call. Don't waste time on people who won't invest<br>5 minutes. They won't be good clients.]<br></code></pre></p>

<h3>Key Principles</h3>

<ol><li class="ordered"><strong>Never do the demo call without them watching the VSL</strong></li>
<li class="ordered"><strong>It's OK to wait on the line while they watch</strong></li>
<li class="ordered"><strong>It's OK to reschedule</strong></li>
<li class="ordered"><strong>It's OK to end the call if they refuse</strong></li>
<li class="ordered"><strong>Driving = reschedule or callback, never do the call</strong></li>
</ol>

<h2>4. OBJECTION HANDLING</h2>

<h3>"How many leads will I get?"</h3>

<pre><code>"I'm gonna be straight with you - I can't tell you that
Susan is gonna see your Google reviews and give you a
$20K job. I can't prove that correlation.

<p>What I do know is the contractors who have professional<br>websites, tons of reviews, and fast follow-up are the<br>ones winning. We give you all the systems to make that<br>happen.</p>

<p>You think it's worth $297 or you don't. But I'm not<br>gonna promise you X leads per month because that would<br>be bullshit."<br></code></pre></p>

<h3>"I've been burned by other companies"</h3>

<pre><code>"I hear that a lot actually. Most marketing companies
overpromise and underdeliver.

<p>Here's how we're different - I'm not promising you leads.<br>I'm giving you systems. The website, the reviews, the<br>missed call follow-up. You saw it in the video.</p>

<p>It either makes sense for $297 or it doesn't. No contracts,<br>cancel anytime. What other questions do you have?"<br></code></pre></p>

<h3>"That's expensive" / "I need to think about it"</h3>

<pre><code>"I get it. Let me ask you this - what's your average job
ticket? $5K? $10K?

<p>So if these systems help you land ONE extra job this year,<br>you're 3-4x'ing what you paid us. One job.</p>

<p>And honestly, $297 is about what you'd spend taking your<br>crew to lunch twice. But I hear you - what specifically<br>do you need to think about?"<br></code></pre></p>

<h3>"Do you have contracts?"</h3>

<pre><code>"Nope. No contracts. Those are just used to trap people
who want to leave. We don't do that.

<p>You can cancel anytime. If we're not delivering value,<br>you shouldn't be paying us. Simple as that."<br></code></pre></p>

<h3>"Let me talk to my wife/partner"</h3>

<pre><code>"Totally get it. When do you think you'll have that
conversation?

<p>[They give timeframe]</p>

<p>Cool, let's get something on the calendar for [day after].<br>That way I can answer any questions they have too.<br>What time works?"<br></code></pre></p>

<h3>"I don't have a website yet"</h3>

<pre><code>"That's actually perfect. Means we don't have to convince
you your current website sucks. We just build you a good
one from scratch.

<p>What other questions do you have?"<br></code></pre></p>

<h3>"I don't have a Google Business page"</h3>

<pre><code>"That's free to set up. Takes about 5 days to get verified.
I'll send you a video showing exactly how to do it.

<p>While you're getting that verified, we'll build your<br>website. By the time it's approved, everything will be<br>ready to connect.</p>

<p>What other questions?"<br></code></pre></p>

<hr>

<h2>5. CLOSING SEQUENCE</h2>

<h3>Order Matters: Card LAST</h3>

<ol><li class="ordered">Business name</li>
<li class="ordered">Address</li>
<li class="ordered">Email (if needed)</li>
<li class="ordered">Card number</li>
<li class="ordered">Expiration</li>
<li class="ordered">CVV</li>
</ol>
<strong>Why this order:</strong> By the time you ask for the card, they've already given you 3-4 pieces of info. They're committed. The card feels like "one more thing" not "the big moment."

<h3>If Card Declines</h3>

<pre><code>YOU: "Hmm, looks like that one didn't go through.
You have another card we can try?"

<p>[If yes, try again]</p>

<p>[If no]</p>

<p>YOU: "No worries. Sometimes it's a daily limit thing.<br>Want to try again tomorrow? I can call you same time."<br></code></pre></p>

<h3>If They Hesitate at Card</h3>

<pre><code>THEM: [Long pause when you ask for card]

<p>YOU: "You good? Any other questions before we get<br>you set up?"</p>

<p>[Let them voice the concern, then handle it]<br></code></pre></p>

<hr>

<h2>6. POST-CALL: HANDOFF</h2>

<ol><li class="ordered"><strong>Add to GHL pipeline</strong> - Move to "Onboarding Form Sent" stage</li>

   Any questions, just text me here."
   </code></pre>
<ol><li class="ordered"><strong>Send onboarding email</strong> - Same link, backup</li>
<li class="ordered"><strong>Notify fulfillment</strong> - Slack/message to whoever builds</li>
</ol>
